# Discord Data bot
*Graph stats about channel activity*

## Examples

Coming soon!

## Commands
`help` - show help in the discord chat

## Installing
This is built with python 3.7 and discord.py, using the graphing libraries XXX

In a terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/random-person-001/discordstats.git && cd discordstats`

You'll need a discord token to get the bot running. Rename `exampleconfig.toml` to `config.toml` and put the token in there.

Then run
`pipenv install` and then `pipenv run python src/main.py`

Your bot should hopefully be running!  Invite it somewhere to test with the link https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=LONGNUMBER&scope=bot, replacing `LONGNUMBER` with your bot's discord ID.
